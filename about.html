      <h2> about me </h2>
 
      
      <p id="about">so. you wanna learn about dear ole me? i'm flattered.<br><br> 

      my name’s macie (you know that by now, right?) i’m eighteen years old and i obsess over makeup and tony stark (huge marvel nerd. slowly getting into the comics.) i’ve lived in the quaint town of avon, ohio for all my life. <br><br>

      school came pretty easy for me. i was always an honor student, always a part of extracurricular activities, and for the most part, pretty social. i had many friends--both online and off. i got along great with the teachers and faculty. i never had any issues. i was a good kid. now i’m a good adult.<br><br> 

        on a more serious note, i will be attending a community college (tuition is free because of my gpa thank god) in hopes of commencing my journey into computer science and web development. after my two years are up, i’ll be heading off to a university to complete my schooling, desiring to earn my masters in computer science and a minor in creative writing and (possibly) theatre. in the midst of voyage through the beginning stages of my adult life, i want to begin freelancing for makeup artistry. i’ll be quite busy, sure, but i’ll be doing the things that i love; and that’s all that matters in the end.</p>
