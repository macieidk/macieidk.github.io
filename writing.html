      <p> ah man. where do i start with writing? i've been writing for as long as i can remember . . . creating chapters . . . writing characters . . . composing a story is something that is mind boogling to me, truthfully. it's amazing that authors have the ability to create a completely new and unique universe that transports its readers to a dimension that is truly remarkable. <br><br>
        i've written many types of stories. i am a guilty party of writing fanfiction. (whoops.) i've written many academical essays for my previous advanced placement classes, many stories, and even a one act play. <br>
        <br>
        writing is hard . . . there's no doubt about it . . . but there is something immensely thrilling about it. <br>
        <br>
        
        i'm known to write about topics that many strive away from due to their own uncomfortableness on the topic. death. alcoholism. depression. negative themes. yet, behind the intensity of agony, there lies a larger message that a multitude of individuals miss because of the darkness. and it's a shame, truthfully. and though many do not wish to read such, the subject content grasps their attention. many good writers have the ability to do such . . . but only great authors have the capability to hold it there. i only hope i have such a power.
