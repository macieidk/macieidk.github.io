          warning: mentions of cancer, death, depression, anxiety, and dark and blunt humor. </div>
        <div id="part1"><p> so you wanna know my life story? buckle up, buttercup. <br><br>

          guess i should start from the beginning; well, i was born in a quaint little town in ohio on february 14th, 1999. sunday. valentines day. and my parents were settin’ the mood with a baby shower. but i came a-knockin’. in other words, my poor mother didn’t get to try the costco cake. shame. <br><br>
          life was pretty easy as a baby. eat. sleep. play. be cute. it was good. everyone loved me. (except when i cried. then i was my parents’ problem.) but anyways, long story short, i was a pretty happy kid. <br><br>

          and then life decided to pull the rug out from my feet. dad was diagnosed with cancer. mom and dad were fighting. dad no longer had cancer. mom wanted a divorce. dad got cancer again. vicious cycle. and it went downhill from there. <br><br>

          my relationship with my dad got rough. my mom and dad’s relationship got worse. we all were unhappy. then my dad’s cancer got worse. the sadness got worse. self esteem issues were at an all time high. and by the time i was twelve, i was diagnosed with a severe depression disorder. and then anxiety decided to come play. <br><br>

          and then high school happened. high school. hah. first year was alright. i was in my school’s marching band . . . choir program . . . was doing pretty alright in my classes. got a lead in the musical. <br><br></div>

      <div id="part2">and then my dad died.<br><br> 

      and stuff got a whole lot worse. <br><br>
      i was put on medication for my depression and anxiety at fifteen. i went to therapy once a week. i was placed into an iop at sixteen (aka intense therapy and crafts. made a lot of cool stuff, actually. and i ain’t an artsy person.) had to drop out of marching band for junior year. had to quit a job i didn’t even start. i lost a lot of friends. it was rough. <br><br>

      and then senior year came. and boom. things were gettin’ better. i began applying for jobs again. i was socializing more. i was in marching band again. in the musical. i got more friends. i was turning eighteen. things were getting better. <br>
      <br>

      long story short, i persevered. i put myself out there. i became confident with myself. i became sure of what i wanted to do. and now i’m here. going to college. getting a job. earning great grades in my classes. making more friends. i was happy. <br><br>

      and i hope i get to make others happy. maybe i could make you happy? who knows. i’d like to think that i could. so, if you’re a possible employer . . . or a director . . . or client . . . whoever . . . i hope i can bring a smile to your face. you’re cute when you smile.
