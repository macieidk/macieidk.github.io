        <p>
          here's your fun fact of the day: i was a girl scout since third grade; and just as one would expect, you can bet your buttons that i accomplished quite a handful in the duration that i participated in the scouts. <br><br>
        community service was a huge accomplishment for me. i'm sure you're wondering . . . okay, she volunteered . . . how is that an accomplishment? well. bringing smiles to those who are less fortunate as i am is quite an accomplishment, if i say so myself. through volunteering at animal shelters, soup kitchens, and nursing homes, i was able to accomplish a wide variety of things. making another happy . . . making an animal feel loved . . . feeding an individual who hadn't had a meal in quite some time . . . that was a pretty awesome accomplishment. in addition to such, i was able to complete my bronze and silver award, and partially work on my gold award. (high school got in the way. i had to quit.) <br><br> 
    but wait, there's more! i was a part of a writing organization for two years. in those two years, i went to district and regional competitions. my last year, i was gifted a medal for seventh place out of the entire competition. (it was out of like . . . 200 students. pretty awesome.) <br><br>

  <div class="awesome"><h3> high school </h3>
      <p>
        all throughout high school i was considered to be a student of high honor in regards to my grades. i maintained a steady gpa of 3.8 throughout my high school career. <br><br> 
        i was in ap classes my last two years. beforehand, i was in honors classes. my grades in those classes never dropped below a b. <br><br> 
      striving away from academics, i happened to be many leads while in theatre. (you can check out a more in depth explanation of my roles and such in projects.) i also became a thespian by the end of my freshman year. i am considered a three star thespian. my junior and senior year, i was in the upper band in my school. sophomore and senior year i was in the upper choir.
