    <h2> future </h2>
      <p> The big question that many have asked me before has been whether or not I was aware of what I would be doing when I grew up. Originally, I would tell them I would be a movie star . . . a superstar . . . rockstar . . . a-lister. didn't we all want to be famous at some point? <br>
        <br>
        now. I know quite well want I desire to be: my own person. Happy. Successful. That's all that truly matters in the end, isn't it? One's happiness. Perhaps I'm one of the few that believe such, for I'm well aware that many in our world wish to be wealthy; thus, sacrificing true happiness . . . genuine love . . . and if I say so myself, that is not something I am willing to give up. <br>
        <br> 
     therefore, i wish to work in a field that brings me joy. how bout that? 
        <br>
        <br>
        after completing high school, i will be attending community college to jumpstart my career in computer science━more specifically web development and design. coding has always been something that i was interested in learning; and when i was granted the chance to do such in my junior year of high school, i fell in love with it. technology has always been something that i was fascinated with━and when i had the opportunity to acquire with such a set of valuable skills, i could not refuse. <br>
        <br>
        after two years of community college, i will be transferring to university to complete my studies. to further my education in something that i love, i wish to obtain a minor in creative writing━more specifically fictional writing. <br>
        <br> 
      in addition, i desire to become a freelance makeup artist. makeup has always been a passion of mine; and it would bring nothing but pleasure to have the chance to work in such a creative field. <br>
        <br> 
        well. that's what i want to do. cool, right? 
        
      </p>
